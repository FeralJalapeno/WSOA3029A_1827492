            I want to specifically talk about the chosen playout for the blog posts and creative work home pages. This is because those two aspects make up the bulk of what I have spent my time on. Below is an example of what the initial layout of these pages looked like. Pay attention to the squares specifically and how they are laid out in rows of three.

            I want to specifically talk about the chosen playout for the blog posts and creative work home pages. This is because those two aspects make up the bulk of what I have spent my time on.

            <p> Initially, all the cards (the posts) were laid out in rows of three. As I did more posts, I realized that I did not like this layout design, but I could not figure out why. I remembered from Cole Knaflic’s readings that you should always ask yourself why you don’t like something or ask yourself why you do. That way you can figure out and dissect the design to figure out it is issues or benefits. </p>
            
            <p>So, after looking at why I did not like this layout, I realized that it became difficult to figure out which posts were specifically an analysis or a close reading or reflection. Of course, this information is on the card, but it felt too tedious and annoying to read through each one. To combat this, All I did was add sections with titles for each row of cards. This helped find posts easily and helped me keep track of how many posts I had done. It also allowed me to keep a balance in my work. For example, for the blog posts, I have an even distribution of content for each section. </p>
            <p>In terms of the Navigation bar layout, I kept it as traditional as possible with the logo of the site on the left in a different, more extravagant font, and the rest plain and simple. The gradient was chosen because it mimics the colour of peaches and it helped later in the site to keep a cohesive colour scheme going. </p>
            <p>For the most part, everything is kept quite simple and to the point. I utilize the cards a lot to have a well-established placeholder for information around the content the card carries. For more about the card design, check out the previous card post under the about section. </p>
