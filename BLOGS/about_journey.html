          <p>This semester has been something else… basically this entire year has been something else. A lot has happened and at the same time, a lot has not. Here is just a rambling on how this semester went for me and how I feel about it.</p>
<p> At the start of the semester, I think the progress , especially for this course, had gotten off on a good start. I had established the bulk of my website design ( such as the cards that I use throughout the website)  and I was enjoying the work. However, things got a lot more difficult as the workload for the other courses increased. </p>

          </p>
<p> The semester suddenly went from “You got this “to “You got this?”. Everything became so extremely frustrating and overwhelming. One course was burning me out from academic reading and writing which led to me to pushing my other subjects (that I actually care about!) aside. I love academic reading and writing, but when it is done in a manner that is beneficial to me. Take this course for example, I have the freedom to pick what readings I want and write up blog posts on them. These blog posts are completely up to me and allow me to engage with the content in whatever manner I feel comfortable and relevant with. However, this other cursed course was not like that. Instead they left us to figure out everything on our own and expected us to be alright with the overload of academic reading they required. In short, that was extremely worthless, and I have left that course with NOTHING. </p>
<p>However, with this course, as much as my technical skills are awful, I have still learnt a lot. Especially when it comes to the theory work, as much as I struggle to use code to create something, I have still learnt a lot from the theory work. That is still beneficial to me. Most of what I have learnt can be applied to a few different things besides data visualisation. I can take this knowledge with me and apply it to everything else that I create and enjoy. </p>

<p> Clearly from the work you see throughout the website, I like and enjoy the blog posts a lot more than anything else. I feel like this is evident through the amount of blog posts there are and how long they seem to be. As much as I understand that the technical aspect is just as important, honestly, I was just so done with this semester. Going back and changing everything to be technically sound and adequate was just not an option considering how much other work I still had to do for the other courses. Yes, it is not an excuse, but rather an explanation on why one aspect just was not up to scratch. Overall, this semester was a lot more enjoyable than the last.</p>
