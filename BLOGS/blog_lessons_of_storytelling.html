        <h1>Lessons in Storytelling</h1>
<p>This post follows up on the previous blog post on Knaflic’s reading. This focuses on chapter 7 and will hopefully help me in establishing a new direction in my creative work section. </p>
<p> Cole begins by stating how most people can recall the plot, the twists, and the ending of the childhood classic – Red Riding Hood. <em>Grandma has fallen ill, and Red Riding Hood sets out on a walk through the woods with a basket of goodies to deliver to her. On her way, she encounters a woodsman and a wolf. The wolf runs ahead, eats Grandma, and dresses up in her clothes. When Red arrives, she senses something is awry. She goes through a series of questions with the wolf (posing as Grandma), culminating in the observation: “Oh, Grandma, how big your teeth are!”—to which the wolf replies, “The better to eat you with!” and swallows Red whole. The woodsman walks by, and, seeing the door to Grandma’s house ajar, decides to investigate. Inside, he finds the wolf dozing after his meal. The woodsman suspects what has happened and chops the wolf in half. Grandma and Red Riding Hood emerge—safe and sound! It is a happy ending for everyone (except the wolf). </em> (Knaflic 2015: 166)</p>
<p>Cole tells us that by recalling this story, we can identify a few important points. The first is the power of repetition. This is evident in how many variations of the story we have heard throughout our lives. This story is quite old, with variants tracing back to the 17th century. This constant repetition and retelling of the story help establish it into our long-term memory. The constant act of reading, hearing, and telling the story reinforces this, as well as it is beginning, middle and end structure. All these factors help with how we recall and then tell the same story to someone else. ( Knaflic 2015: 166)</p>
<h3>The magic of story </h3>
<p>“A good story grabs your attention and takes you on a journey, evoking an emotional response.” ( Knaflic 2015: 167). The true magic is how after you experience a good story, no matter how much time passes, you can easily recall it and retell it to someone else. Cole tells us how we can take this memorability and use it as a powerful tool. As said, stories marry the notion of ideas with emotion. This is what hooks in an audience and keeps their attention. The key point Cole makes at the start of this chapter revolves around using stories to engage with out audience on an emotional level. She points out how facts alone are incapable of engaging with their audience emotionally. I supposed that’s where bringing in the concept of story telling together with data is necessary. 
  </p>
<h3>Important notes</h3>
<p>Cole goes through the important points in story telling in writing. I will briefly discuss these points and how and why I think it is good practise to consider with data visualisation creation. The first point is to find a subject you care about. When it comes to something you have any genuine care for, your efforts and mindset when creating it show. It may sound very flowery and cheesy but remember the previous blog post and the whole “make your choices intentional”? This refers to having care about the subject. When you have care, you have genuine intent and therefore your choice on that subject becomes intentional. </p>
<p>The next two points are remembering not to ramble and keeping it simple. Rambling is an awful thing to do, especially in storytelling. Not getting to the point and putting in redundant and unnecessary information can become extremely frustrating and lead to boredom. This will result in bad storytelling since it is not holding the audience’s attention. It is extremely vital that we look at the most praised and profound writers in history, such as Shakespeare. When their subjects were profound and held complex content, their language became simpler and more concise. Why? Because being simple and concise is key to getting the overall point across, as discussed in previous blog posts. </p>
<p>The next point is cutting out stuff. Often, writers will struggle to cut out sections or “kill their darlings” as my lecturers would say. Sometimes, the things we create can be beautiful, they can be amazing, but they just do not work with our subject. Sometimes it is better to cut out a good portion because it has the potential to bring down the overall work in the long run. Another point is to remember to sound like yourself and therefore speak like yourself. If you do not speak like Shakespeare, then do not pretend to. This does not mean you cannot dabble in the same language or themes, it just means that you should stay true to your authentic self and not pretend to be you’re your favourite writer by mimicking their own style.</p>
<p>Saying what you mean to say is probably one of my favourite points. I mention this quite often in other areas of the website – being clear and concise is key. Do not find over exaggerated or convoluted methods in getting to your point. Rather, be clear about what you are trying to do and be concise about it. As we see in data visualization, avoiding the clear and concise route leads to a situation where the subject/data is difficult to understand. </p>
<p>The last point is having pity on the readers/audience. Again, the point to be clear with what you are trying to do is vital. Specifically, with data visualisation, often the data audiences are meant to digest cover topics they have little to no knowledge or practise in. By being patient with our process and carefully considering how they will digest the information, we can feed them the information and our intentions in a simple manner that they can understand. At the end of the day, we create these stories to share them with others. Therefore, we cannot communicate for ourselves but rather for the audience since the story is for them. </p>
<h3>The power of repetition</h3>
<p>Now, this chapter talks a lot about storytelling in different forms and offers plenty of advice, but I will rather expand on the power of repetition mentioned earlier. As said earlier, Cole supports using the power of repetition we see is classic stories and using it. If we create something that has people being able to easily recall and retell their experience, then we have done a good job. Cole mentions this concept of “Bing, Bang Bongo” that was used to assist with their essay writing. ( Knaflic 2015: 180). The Bing refers to introducing your subject. The bang refers to discussing the actual content discussion of your subject and the bong is a summary of the bang. Essentially, this concept can be applied a few things including work presentations, arguments etc. </p>

<p>Earlier we said to pity your audience, the same applies with this process. Repeating your ideas as you move through your essay or presentation may seem redundant, but it’s important to remember that you are familiar with this idea and your audience is not. You are initially establishing to them exactly what you are going to discuss, then you go into detail about those things and give them a recap. This sense of repetition assists in leaving your story in their minds and help them remember it later ( Knaflic 2015: 181).  </p>
<p>If stories have this much potential, why would not we harness its power and apply it to other factors around us. When it comes to data visualisation, my own, I think it would be best if I rather try and tell a story through the data visualisation instead of just leaving the graph as is. Considering the previous post, I think even the simplest of graphs have the potential to tell a story. Provided that every choice made around it is intentional. </p>
