            <h3>Reflecting on Knaflic</h3>
            <p>
            Creating interactive data-driven artworks, using D3, was the most difficult thing for me to do in this entire project. With my technical skills already being at an all time low, trying to use the more complex visualisations like the world maps were extremely difficult for me to execute. Unfortunately, I had to stick to what I understood and what could work with breaking. You can find more detail about each graph under the actual graphs. Here I will mainly be focusing on my work overall.
            </p>
            <p>
            After reading Cole Knaflic’s chapters, I wanted to try and incorporate a story into my data visualisation. My issue is that whatever I envisioned and what I could do did not meet at the same level. I found myself sticking to the basic graphs that I had been using throughout the semester and trying to at least produce something. As much as I understand how much potential data-driven art has, there comes a point where I need to accept and validate what I am capable of. This did let me down during the exam season, as I was wasting hours upon hours trying to get csv. files to work and then getting frustrated because I could have worked on a different exam with that time. Basically, I chose to take Knaflic’s chapter 6 on “Dissecting Model Visuals” and apply her logic and advice on data visualisation. You can find some of this discussion under the graph as well.
            </p>
            <h3>Representational and Communication Strategies</h3>
            <p>In Knaflic’s chapter 6, she goes over what makes good data visualisation in simple graphs. These points can be applied to most designs in any field. Throughout the blog I emphasize how much being clear and concise is mentioned and reaffirmed. One of the key points I took away from the chapter was the use of colour. In the data visualisation, you see the use of the bright pink colour for the bars – the same pink you see throughout the website. Not only does this colour stick to the theme of the overall website, but it also acts as a single, attention grabbing colour for the audience to focus on. The rest of the graph is left in a simple black colour, for readability since it involves text and to keep the attention on the coloured bars. To bring emphasis to these bars, the rest of the graph had to be deemphasized in the process. </p>
            <p>However, the point of having two graphs was to compare how few beds per thousand people there are compared to the number of confirmed cases. I do not think these graphs executed this comparison very well. Essentially, one should be able to see how few beds are available compared to the amount of cases. But the way the graphs are laid out leads to this information being overlooked at first glance. Because the bars stay the same size as the graphs change, at first glance users cannot visually notice how few beds each country has available. To combat this, something that could hold both data sets would be better, that way users can easily identify what is being compared. </p>
            <p>The buttons that change the data set also contribute to a few of my design choices. Instead of putting titles and labels around the graph and the x and y axis, I opted to condense the text and keep it in the buttons. Why did I do this? Knaflic constantly tells us throughout her readings that being concise and clear is important for good data visualisation. I felt that putting the text in the button would allow audiences to see what data they were about to click on. By clicking on, say the “Confirmed cases for COVID-19 “button, audiences are aware that they are specifically looking at data for confirmed cases. </p>
            <p> However, I do feel as if the buttons could have had a simple animation of sorts, to give audiences more feedback that these buttons are something they can interact with. The cards you see throughout the blog have a lot of visual feedback to audiences to show they what they can interact with. I think having the same for these buttons could have helped a little. Right now, they just look like blocks with text in them. </p>
            <h3>End thoughts</h3>
            <p>The issue is that the graphs themselves do not create the emotion or effect I was going for. This all comes down to what was discussed above, regarding the layout of the graphs and maybe the choice of graph used. Therefore, the graph does not execute the “story” I wished to tell well enough.</p>
            
            
                <p>A still think combining the data sets onto one graph would have been a better choice or having them alongside each other with the same numerical labelling on the side. This would help visually communicate the comparison of how few beds there are available to the number of confirmed cases. </p>
