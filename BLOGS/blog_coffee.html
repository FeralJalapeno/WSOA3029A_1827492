        <h1>Caffiene vs. Sugar</h1>
        <h3> representaion and communication strategies</h3>
        <p>This post analyses the Caffiene vs. Sugar post from informationisbeautiful.net. You can see the entire image display at the bottom of this blog post. </p>
        <p>To start off, I find the display of the information very pleasing. It’s simple and straightforward with the information it is representing. The information is easily digested as opposed to reading out how much sugar is in a different drink.</p>
        <p>There are key elements that are always considered when trying to reach effective visual communication. The key elements I will be discussing are colour, typography, layout, callouts, space, illustration, iconography, data, proportion, and simplicity.  Colour refers to using a restrictive colour palette. No more than five colours should ever be used. This example stays true to that element and appears to only make use of five colours. Also, I’d like to point out the use of creams and browns- colours that represent the topic itself- coffee! Another key element is typography. The font should be legible and cohesive. This post keeps the font consistent and readable. </p>
        <p>Another important element would be layout. Looking at the example, we can clearly see what the point of this information is- show display how much caffeine and sugar is in specific drinks. The way the information it set up makes identifying the caffeine and sugar content much easier. We can clearly see that the further left a drink is on the graph, the more caffeine it contains. The higher you move up on the graph, the more sugar a drink contains. This is quite a clever way of representing such data. The graph system shows how simply caffeine and sugar content in drinks can be displayed.</p>
        <p>Callouts refer to something that is sparingly used. Effective highlights are used sparingly and only to highlight key information. I’d day there are two callouts in this example. On the right we see four sport figures in white to display how much time would need to be spent doing that activity to burn off the calories in the food items. The other would be the blue text backing on food and drinks with zero levels of caffeine on the far left. </p>
        <p>Spacing, specifically negative space is important to avoid a clutter of information that becomes difficult to read. This example makes excellent use of negative space and spreads out the information to appear as coherent as possible.</p>
        <p>Illustration and Iconography are big elements in this example. The subject matter is coffee, therefore each food and drink is designed simply- only showing the silhouette of each item. This keeps things simple and easy to read. Heavily designed icons would become a distraction and make the information harder to read. Design that had little variant shaping would also contribute to having the information hard to read. By finding the balance between detail and simplicity, the information displayed becomes ore effective in it’s representation. </p>
        <p>This ties into the data being presented. It is important to not overwhelm a reader with various graphs and such. This example combines the data sets of caffeine content, sugar content, calories as well as physical activity equivalent to those calories all in one simple graphing system.</p>
        <p>When referring to proportion, it is important that things are sized appropriately to avoid skew data. In this example, it appears that the sizes of the images are meant to mimic their relative sizes. A small drink appears smaller while a large drink appears large. I do not think this skews the data, but rather makes it relative to what is represented. This way, readers can understand that this is a small drink, and this is a larger drink.</p>
         <p>As I said before, simplicity is a key point and this example stays true to that. It avoids unnecessary design/details from its imagery to its text and graphing lines.
         <p>This was just a short analyses on some of the key points to effective visual communication and how this example stays true to those key points.</p>
