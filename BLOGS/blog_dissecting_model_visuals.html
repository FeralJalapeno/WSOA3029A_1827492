        <h1> Dissecting Model Visuals </h1>
        <p>
            Here I will be look at chapter 6 of Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic’s “Storytelling with data”. I have been struggling with my creative section of this website and I feel like the chapter helps with some of my concerns with my own work and gives me better direction. I have watched a few of her interviews and realized a lot more about data visualization. These points will be further addressed in the exam blog posts. For now, I will be discussing this specific chapter that covers good data visualisation by referring to and analysing model visuals. It is important to understand what you are emphasizing to gain the audience’s attention, as well what must be de-emphasized in the process.
            </p>
            <h1>Model Visuals</h1>
            <h3>The Line Graph</h3>
            <p>When it comes to a good line graph, there must be a good use of text to make the visual (the bar graph) accessible and understandable. The title and labels on the vertical and horizontal axis should be present, clear, and concise. With correct and to-the-point labelling, information is easier to digest as it avoids audiences having to look around, trying to decipher the information.  These graphs can indeed be useful in expressing complex information if labelling is carefully considered. As Cole tells us, something like preserving the amount of zero’s you display in the axis labels can assist in making the visual easier to digest. So, instead you can title the y-axis with something like “number of Covid-19 recoveries (in the thousands)” and minimise using larger numbers. Overall, this just helps minimise the amount of information being displayed. Afterall, being concise is also an important factor</p>
            <h3>The Stacked Bars</h3>
            <p>As discussed in the line graph, Cole repeats how words make the visual accessible. The title and labelling is still important, especially when labels are done in such a way that works with the data and reduces redundant labelling and therefore makes the  data much easier to read and process ( Knaflic, 2015:158) . Now, since the importance of text has been mentioned in both examples already, what does it tell us? Personally, I see it as the text being a pillar of support for the visual data. Without this support, the data might as well fall to nothing. Without the text to indicate what that data is referring to; it becomes impossible to correctly interpret the data. I suppose the same would be applied to incorrectly placed text. The point is, text is essential in understanding the data being presented and if it is done incorrectly, it works on the same level as there being no text. </p>
            <p>Cole also points out how colour can be used to keep the audience’s attention focused on specific aspects of visualization. In her example with the stacked bars, she points out how using red as a single attention-grabbing colour pushes the audience to focus on whatever data is displayed with that colour. (Knaflic, 2015:157). Everything else is displayed in variations of grey. This is a good example that shows that, in the process of creating emphasis to gain the audience’s attention, other aspects had to be deemphasized. By keeping everything else in a  grey scale, this allows for the audience to still focus on the other series of data BUT it does not take away the direct emphasis of the data in the red colour. </p>
            <h3>So … what is the point? </h3>
            <p>Essentially, in this chapter of her reading, Cole wants us to realize that there is extreme value in examining the design choices and visual displays used to create data visualizations. From looking at two examples she discussed, the line graph and stacked bar graph, we can establish that careful consideration to text and colour can go a long way in data representation. These elements help direct the audience’s attention to certain elements of the data and should always be as clear and concise as possible. Redundant labelling and overuse of colour only makes digesting and analysing the visual data difficult.  </p>
            <h3>What does this mean for me?</h3>
            <p>Cole states that in every single piece of data visualization there is something we can learn from it.  These can be good things as well as bad. (Knaflic, 2015:163). We should always ask ourselves why we like something or why we do not like it. When I look back at my analyses blog posts, I can see why I liked the data visualisations discussed there. The use of text and colour and how it was used to establish emphasis and a point of interest was good. It is important to understand that different people will have different approaches when it comes their design choices. But, for every design choice made we should always be asking why we are making this choice and what making the choice does. We need to understand and consider all our design choices since the “primary importance is that your design choices be just that: intentional.” (Knaflic, 2015:163). When I look at my first two data visualisations, there is not much intention in the design choices I had. They were just done for the sake of having some sort of data visualisation. When I look at Cole’s work, I realize how much more can be done with data visualisation. Of course, my technical competence is also considered but even simple graphs have potential. </p>
            <p>The next blog post will look at Cole’s next chapter on story telling. I utilize this chapter to try and incorporate storytelling with the COVID-19 data sets in a way that links to the overall theme of the website. Like discussed before, every decision should be intentional and hopefully that can come through in my work.</p>
