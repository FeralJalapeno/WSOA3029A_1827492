          <h1> A Utopian Belief in Big Data</h1>
<p>
This section in Janssens, “The Art of Ethics in the information society” tells us that government agencies have increasingly been turning to data-driven strategies in order to steer and regulate society (Janssens, 2016, p.1). What is meant by this is that we will see news outlets tells us how government agencies (such as the military or police force) have decreased the cases of gang violence by a certain percentage. This is one of the many examples of a data-driven policy intervention that is based on “Big data”.
</p>
<p>
Big data does not seem to have a common definition, but it refers to “the automated analysis of-often combined – data sets, to look for patterns or correlations based on which predictions can be made.” (Janssens, 2016, p.1). It is widely described as a revolution that has majorly influenced and changed the way in which we do research, business and develop policies. This Big Data should enable governments to identify the future concerns and manage the level of risk and loss. This Big data is essential to developing effective, data-driven and citizen centred policies. 
</p>
<p>
Big data is more probability than it is certainty as it ideally promises to make the future feel less like a cesspool of uncertainty. This idea makes people ignorant towards the new complexities that inevitably occur. It is important to remember that technology often brings forth unseen and unwanted occurrences. Big data can help us cope with whatever circumstances technology brings but with that grows the human urge for more. Human beings do not want to simple cope with the contingent world- they want to overcome it. This section discusses how the want to overcome contingency is unfeasible and undesirable.
</p>
<h3>A Complex World</h3>
<p>All living things live in a complex world where the world itself contains more possibilities than the living things will ever know a fraction of. To understand these possibilities, the complexity must be reduced. This is challenging for human beings since they are aware of the world’s contingency. Since human beings are aware that the world, their lives and furthermore could be different, they consequently also are aware that they are responsible for what their environment becomes. It then becomes impossible to overcoming the consequences that occur after their choices have been made. Therefore, complexity exists in the human world by means of two elements, the other and the future ( Janassens, 2016, p.1). This means that humans face the actions of others who are, to an extent, free to see and things differently yet, humans also deal with the idea of not knowing what the future holds. They deal with knowing that there could be countless future possibilities yet only one of those possibilities can exist in the future. The anticipation of what reality that is then becomes the looming question. We see it constantly in our society when we look at the topic of global warming. There are numerous articles, videos and posts conceptualising the future possibilities and how they all depend on the actions we take today. The complexities dwell even further since humans have an eccentric positionality. Not only do they experience their own experiences, thoughts, and actions but an inherent part of their life is eccentric. It is due to this eccentric positionality that humans are aware and reflexive.

</p>
<h3>Artificial by Nature
</h3>
<p>
The paper discusses how humans can be deemed homeless by nature since it is plainly through technology and their creative methods of carving out their lives, does this world they inhabit become less complex. Human beings can then be seen as artificial by nature. This means that human beings cannot be understood or represented without the very tools they use to influence and shape their lives with. Big data is one of the preferred tools when is comes to reducing the complexity. It’s predictive power allows governments to control the behaviour of their citizens. This shows us that the two primary sources of complexity lie within an unknown future and the behaviour of others. ( Janassens, 2016, p.2). An example the paper uses discusses predicted where traffic congestion can occur. We can see this very example in our everyday lives, especially if one travels to a dense hub like the city of Joburg. Big Data is evident when we see traffic officers directing traffic in certain zones leading up towards the city. What occurs is, real-time traffic control is able to predict where and why certain zones condense with so much traffic. Then, traffic officers would be dispatched to those locations to control the traffic flow. This helps majorly since people are now forced to listen to how police officers control traffic rather than the specific time of the traffic lights. 
</p>
<h3>Utopian Beliefs</h3>
<p>
Technology creates a temporary shelter for humans that keeps them confined to this artificial world they have created. Their lives are constantly under construction since technology is progressing at such a rapid state and therefore, continuously changing the human environment. 
Humans strive for a life of simplicity where it exists in a certain and stable context. In a way its as if they wish the world, they create to be well-thought out and perfect, to the point where the social constructs and laws almost feel natural. As the paper goes on, it tells us how human beings desire to have the technology embody them and reach a point of transparency that is at the same level as there being no technology at all. Yet, there is also the desire for control-power, something technology gives.
Essentially, there is a desire to eliminate complexity.
</p>
<p>
There is a massive Utopian belief in how much power technology has. The belief has expectations of the future becoming entirely predictable at some point. Datafication, the process of capturing actions and behaviours into readable data, holds the promise that human behaviour will become entirely predictable and eventually entirely controllable. This sort of utopian belief is extremely flawed and dangerous to pursue. We can see the dangers and complexity of such an ideology in AI’s that have already been created and critiqued. An example would be an AI that was created with the claim to be highly successful at identifying a criminal- even before they ever committed a crime. The creators claimed that their AI could identify future criminals and therefore predict ( and control) that context of society. But, of course there were plenty of issues around why this was entirely unreliable and not ethical. However, the thought of having such technology run our human lives sounds terrifying. It is impossible to imagine a world where people, probably even children, could be targeted out as something undesirable for the society, even long before they have done anything wrong. But again, reaching such a level in technology would involve an insane amount of progress and research that is not only accurate, but stays true to ethical concerns and values. This is almost impossible since data produced cannot speak for itself. It must be interpreted which involves a set of limits and biases. By not eliminating the limits and biases when it comes to data interpretation and analyses, the risk of misinterpretation becomes evident. 
</p>
<p>
Humans have become so cemented to technology and the predictability it has to offer. We see this reliance and faith on predictability everywhere, from weather forecasts, stock markets and even your food delivery apps. This hinders the inherent societal intelligence and resilience and leads to a, well , boring way of life. Imagining a world where everything becomes predictable almost seems like a world not worth living in. Imagine being able to predict exactly when you would have a baby or predict the gender of the baby before its even been conceived. Imagine being able to predict who will be your friends and who will not. That sounds boring, in the sense that nothing will ever be a surprise – just a known fact. Keeping these thoughts in mind, it is important to remember them when newer strategies are brought forward to reduce complexity. These strategies should honour the eccentric nature of humans rather than to control is entirely.
