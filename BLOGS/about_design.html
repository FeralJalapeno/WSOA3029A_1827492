          <h1> Design and Layout</h1>
          <p> Here you will find me explaining my design choices for the website.</p>
          <h3>Blog Post Layout</h3>
          <p> Below you can see a screenshot showing a section of the blog posts. Since a total of six blog posts are required this semester, I decided to
              break down and display the blog posts evenly. With this method, readers can easily identify which posts are close readings, analyses and critical reflections. This also
              ensured that I keep an even distribution of academic content for the website.
          </p>
          <p>My issue with this display is that it restricted me to only doing three blog posts. Of course, I did not want to waste time changing the design or layout
              so I left it as is. It will most likely change as the semester progresses or at least be altered to make room for more blog posts besides the 
              required six. If you go to the blog homepage, you will see that two of the posts have over 1 500 words. When it comes to the readings I realize that 
              I enjoy them and have a lot to say. So, in that case, it only makes sense that I accomodate for more posts.
          </p>

           <h3>Card Design</h3>
           <p> I would say that most of my effort went into creating the cards for the website. The reason for the design was to convey as much information to the reader in a way that did not seem too overwhelming and was aesthetically pleasing to look at, i.e had decent UI design. Each card represents one blog post.
               I tried my best to use an image associated with the blogs context and at the same time have it link to the theme and aesthetics I have going on throughout the website.
           The blog posts are specifically broken up into sections ( as seen in the image above) so that things could look a bit more organised and you would not have to read every card to figure out which one is an analyses or which on is a close reading.
            </p>
  <h3>Each Element Explained</h3>
           <p> The cards contents were carefully considered. The first bit of text you see is very small, but it shows the date of when the blog post was written. This is kept small because it is not (in my opinion) vital information about the context of the blog. Before someone had to decide on whether they wanted to read the post, I feel as if the title and content are more important that the date.
               Right after that you see the heading of the Blog post. The change in font and font-size was necessary to bring attention to an important aspect â€“ the title. The title is done in the same, fancy cursive text you see in the logo of the navigation bar. The main choice of this text change was to add variation and primarily for aesthetic purposes.
               At first glance, the reader might notice the image first and then the title of the blog post. The image is also primarily for aesthetic purpose, but the image also relates to the content in some way or another. The rest of the information on the cards are left in the same font and
               font-size to help keeps things simple and easy to read. Effective UI design limits itself with callouts.
           </p>
           <p>At the bottom of each card, we see three bits of information. I will be referring to mainly the blog post cards here. I thought it would be a great touch to add the word count, along with an estimated amount of time it would take to read the post and the number
               of sources used. The amount of time it will take to read the post is calculated on wordstotime.com. The average reading time of 130 words per minutes
               is selected just to get a basic estimate. Is it necessary? Probably not but I genuinely do enjoy the layout of this information. I somewhat find it very
               pleasing to look at. This was a very personal choice due to how much academic reading I have had to endure. Sometimes it would be nice to know, on average, how long it would take to read something.
           </p>
  <h3>Colours and Style</h3>
  <p>The main colour of the cards is a bright pink colour. When you look at the navigation bar, this pink colour is the start of the gradient. This pink colour is reinforced and used through the website to maintain a theme. The text at the bottom of the cards are put in white since it is easier to read and see than the colour black, due to the pink background. </p>
  <p>If you hover over any card, you will see that it pops up a bit and has a shadow. This was done to give users some visual feedback that the cards were interactable. Since a lot of the content revolves around interactivity, I thought it would be a nice touch make the cards like this. Having this sort of effect is good UI practise when you want users to identify what they can click on. </p>
