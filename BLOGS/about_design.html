    <h1> Design and Layout</h1>
        <p> Here you will find me explaining my design choices for the website.</p>
        <h3>Blog Post Layout</h3>
        <p> Below you can see a screenshot showing a section of the blog posts. Since a total of six blog posts are required this semester, I decided to
            break down and display the blog posts evenly. With this method, readers can easily identify which posts are close readings, analyses and critical reflections. This also
            ensured that I keep an even distribution of academic content for the website.
        </p>
        <p>My issue with this display is that it restricted me to only doing three blog posts. Of course, I did not want to waste time changing the design or layout
            so I left it as is. It will most likely change as the semester progresses or at least be altered to make room for more blog posts besides the 
            required six. If you go to the blog homepage, you will see that two of the posts have over 1 500 words. When it comes to the readings I realize that 
            I enjoy them and have a lot to say. So, in that case, it only makes sense that I accomodate for more posts.
        </p>

         <h3>Card Design</h3>
         <p> I'd say that most of my effort went into creating the cards for the website. The reason for the design was to convey as much information to the reader
             im a way that did not seem too overwhelming and was aesthetically pleasing to look at, i.e had decent UI design.
