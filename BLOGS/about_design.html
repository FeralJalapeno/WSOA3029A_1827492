    <h1> Design and Layout</h1>
        <p> Here you will find me explaining my design choices for the website.</p>
        <h3>Blog Post Layout</h3>
        <p> Below you can see a screenshot showing a section of the blog posts. Since a total of six blog posts are required this semester, I decided to
            break down and display the blog posts evenly. With this method, readers can easily identify which posts are close readings, analyses and critical reflections. This also
            ensured that I keep an even distribution of academic content for the website.
        </p>
        <p>My issue with this display is that it restricted me to only doing three blog posts. Of course, I did not want to waste time changing the design or layout
            so I left it as is. It will most likely change as the semester progresses or at least be altered to make room for more blog posts besides the 
            required six. If you go to the blog homepage, you will see that two of the posts have over 1 500 words. When it comes to the readings I realize that 
            I enjoy them and have a lot to say. So, in that case, it only makes sense that I accomodate for more posts.
        </p>

         <h3>Card Design</h3>
         <p> I'd say that most of my effort went into creating the cards for the website. The reason for the design was to convey as much information to the reader
             in a way that did not seem too overwhelming and was aesthetically pleasing to look at, i.e had decent UI design. Each card represents one blog post.
             I tried my best to use an image associated with the blogs context and at the same time have it link to the soft, pink theme I have going on.
         </p>
         <p> The cards contents was carefully considered. The first bit of text you see is very small but it shows the date of when the blog post was written.
             Right after that you see the heading of the Blog post. The change in font and font-size was necessary to bring attention to important aspects.
             At first glance, the reader might notice the image first and then the title of the blog post. The rest of the information is left in the same font and
             font-size to help keeps things simple and easy to read. Effective UI design limits itself with callouts.
         </p>
         <p>I also thought it would be a great touch to add the word count, along with an estimated amount of time it would take to read the post and the number
             of sources used. The amount of time it will take to read the post is calculated on wordstotime.com. The average reading time of 130 words per minutes
             is selected just to get a basic estimate. Is it necessary? Probably not but I genuinely do enjoy the layout of this information. I somewhat find it very
             pleasing to look at.
