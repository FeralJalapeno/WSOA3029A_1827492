          <h1> Artistic Data Visualisation: Beyond Visual Analytics </h1>
<p>
Information visualization is commonly viewed as a tool for data exploration and a way to hypothesise formation. Because of its roots in scientific reasoning, visualization has been seen as an analytical tool for sensemaking. In recent years, however, both the mainstreaming of computer graphics and the democratization of data sources on the Internet have had important repercussions in the field of information visualization. (Fernanda and Wattenburg, p. 1)
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Data Visualization is seen as a tool to support analytic reasoning. This paper discusses the implications that come with the increased interest of visualization amongst artists. Section 2 will define and describe important and relevant terms. Section 3, also the focus of the paper, provides an analysis of several prominent examples of artistic visualizations. Section 4 will then offer suggestions on how the academic visualization community can learn from artists involved on visualization.
</p>
<h3>Definitions and Background</h3>
<p>
Defining art is already a difficult task, so naturally defining artistic visualization would also prove to be difficult. Artistic visualizations are visualizations of data done by artists with the intent of making art (Fernanda and Wattenburg, p. 2). It may seem like a tautology (the saying of the same thing twice over in different words), but it specifies a coherent class of work. The artworks need to be based off of actual data instead of utilizing metaphors. The paper also points out, “A second point is that our definition avoids the issue of beauty: we do not contend that beautiful scientific visualizations are automatically artistic, or that visualization art must be pretty.” (Fernanda and Wattenburg, p. 3). The focus on intent rather than the look, the aesthetics, provides a coherent category of artwork that is important in distinguishing characteristics from scientific visualizations. This means that a photograph taken under a microscope of some bacteria does not qualify to the papers definition, regardless of how beautiful the image is. The surge of software development and access to these tools is one of the factors that caused this type of visualization to occur. We can see in our modern society how cheap it can be to create such visualization, one could merely use their cell phone. The second factor is that data has merged to become part of the cultural discourse. The internet has made complex data available with such easy access to it and governments use collections of data that are critical to the lives of their citizens.

<p>
The paper discusses a few examples of this visualisation, but I will briefly look at one of the examples. The “Last Clock” utilizes video footage to record time. Like an actual analogue clock, it has a minute hand and an hour hand. The hands are arranged in concentric circles with the outer being the seconds, middle being minutes and the inner being hours. Each hand is made using a section of a live video feed. As the hands rotate, they leave behind a still of what occurred Infront of the camera. After a few hours, the clock will become a unique representation of the surroundings. The paper states how this form of visualisation is not well suited for surveillance or anything to do with watching footage, but rather it is prominent in terms of creating a record of time and space. In my opinion, I think that’s an extremely creative way of taking data and creating something artistic from it. This links up to the definition of artistic visualization since the intent was to make an artwork rather than create something with a strict purpose ( such as for video surveillance archiving or something along those lines).
</p>
<p>
The artistic visualisations in this paper all share a common point, they embody a forceful point of view. It’s as if the artworks gain power through the artists defying the norms of visual analytics. The “Last Clock” distorts video footage in such a way that would not be ideal or necessary for real-life surveillance. Yet, as an image of a clock and representing the key points of what a clock does- it works well. The paper also states, “A more radical change in attitude would be to embrace the fact that visualizations can be used to persuade as well as analyse.” (Fernanda and Wattenburg, p. 10). It goes on to say that neutral analysis is not the only important task in life and there is valid reasoning in wanting to change the way people think. Visualization holds immense value with the ability to change peoples’ attitudes. Its important to realize that most of these visualizations are made using techniques and processed developed through academia yet, it is used in a very different style. The paper ends in saying that a lot can be learnt from this artistic use and asks if data visualisation researchers investigate ways to support making a point as well as analysis? I think they should.
