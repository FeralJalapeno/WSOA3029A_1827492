        <h1>Theories of Representation</h1>
        <h3>by Kidd,J.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>There are a number of debates that complicate the concept of representation. 
            Personally, my time at university has not only opened my perspective on the concept but also confused me. 
            Kidd discusses a variety of examples in order to look into a few of the key questions related to these debates.</p> 
        <h3> representation and reality</h3>
        <p>Representation is concerned with the construction of meaning. 
            Our reality is a mere construct of media and cultural texts made through signs and signifiers. 
            The study of these signs and signifiers is know as semiotics. 
            Kidd indulges in a few papers on semiology to expand on the representation discussion.</p> 
        <p>Semiotics help us understand language and how it operates. 
            This is based on the ideas on Ferdinand de Saussure (1959) and Charles Sanders Peirce (1894). These ideas have since been expanded on with multiple studies of various other cultural texts and media. 
            The foundation of semiotics is based on the understanding languages and signs used in everyday social contexts that shape the reality in which we live. 
            It implies that signs influence and shape our perceptions instead of reflecting a reality that already exists ( Bignell 1997, p.6).</p>
