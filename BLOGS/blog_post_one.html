        <h1>Theories of Representation</h1>
        <h3>by Kidd,J.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Kidd starts off by stating that, “Representation has no straightforward window on the world” (Kidd, 2015, p.19). I believe that this simple quote sums up the complexity of representation. As Kidd tells us, there are vast amounts of arguments and debates that revolve around the concept of representation. And, as most academic arguments and debates like to do, these have resulted in the concept of representation becoming unnecessarily complicated. Of course, this concept of representation is not simple or straightforward but, it does not have to be complicated to understand.</p>
        <p> Kidd attempts to simplify the concept of representation by breaking it down into five key points. This blog post will briefly discuss and summarize each of those key points below:</p>
        <h3>Representation and Reality</h3>
        <p>Kidd tells us that signs shape our perceptions, rather than reflecting a reality that already exists somewhere in the world. To understand how representation produces meaning, Kidd discusses Stuart Hall’s constructivist theory. We look at this theory to understand the concept of signs and signifiers. Semiotics is basically the study of signs. This is important to representation since media and cultural texts involve the usage of signs to form reality and essentially meaning. Our everyday lives are immersed in representation. It shapes how we understand everything around us, including ourselves. ( Webb 2009, p.3)</p>
        <p>Kidd gives us a good explanation on semiotics, “The purpose of semiotics is to study these factors, and to try systematically to come to an understanding of how X=Y (Danesi 2008), and under what circumstances. In Saussurean semiotics, it is the coming together of signifier and signified (the form and the idea) which gives us the sign. There is a difference being marked here between the form and the conceptual level of meaning making, and the connection between them is, as we noted, arbitrary. These connections are instead dependent on context, and on social and cultural cues.”</p>
        <p>Therefore, signs are completely embedded into the meanings that exist around us and then influence our beliefs and opinions around things. A great Stuart Hall quote puts it very simple, “Nothing is born into the world with meaning, but it is assigned a meaning” (Hall 1997: 25). In short, we can say that signs are what meaning and meaning is what influences and defines our reality.</p>
        <h3>Representation and Myth</h3>
        <p>A French semiotician, Roland Barthes, brought attention to the value of tools of semiotics in the 1950’s. He was interested in the “relationship between what is seen, and what is understood at the level of myth; in the distinction between what he called the denotations and the connotations in a text” ( Kidd, 2015). Barthes theories allow us to think about the connotative functions of representation whereas Saussure’s theories were denotative. The article uses the Apple logo to discuss the distinction between connotation and denotation regarding the active work of logos.</p>

        <p>In the denotative aspect of the sign the logo is just a mere representation of an apple. The Apple products have connotations attached to them such as being desirable and meant for people with a lot of money. However, the logo can also connotate negative things such as seeing the users as clout chasers who only buy the products for social status. Of course, the company does not intend for these negative connotations to occur, but media messages can be rejected, our readings subversive (Hall 1980). This is a good example as it concludes that the Apple logo is not apparent. It cannot be read at its denotative level as a mere apple and nothing more than that.</p>
        <p> With this, I would like to discuss something a bit different. Let us look at the Nazi flag. The unfortunate truth is that Hitler took an ancient symbol (that is still recognised and represented is communities to this day) and made it the centre piece for the Nazi flag. He took the swastika – a symbol of well-being and good fortune and used it to promote hate and press his monstrous movement. The Nazi symbol is banned in a number of countries, yet the original swastika is still a sacred symbol in Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and Odinism. It is not uncommon to see this symbol in current households, temples, and ancient </p>

        <h3>Representation and Visual Communication</h3>
        <p>Now, effect visual communication is no easy task. As Jostein Gripsrud stated, ‘images are composed of elements that are not as clearly distinguished as the word-signs of verbal language. The meanings of images are therefore often unclear, fleeting or plural’ (Gripsrud 2006: 32). Therefore, interpretation is much more subjective and ambiguous. Images contain symbols and these symbols have various meanings. Despite the embedded meanings within objects, the meaning it up to the audience. This means that the meanings are entirely influenced on a number of factors like time or culture – therefore, meaning is not fixed when it comes to images (Gripsrud 2006: 32).</p>
        <p>To assist with interpreting images, Kidd suggests some points to be aware of when doing so. She discusses the images presentation context, production context, historical context and the context of reception. When looking at the presentational context, she asks where the image appears. She uses the examples of portraits; the meanings can be different depending on location. A portrait of someone in a locket around someone’s neck can have an exceptionally different meaning to a framed portrait in a museum. The production context refers to who produced the image, where and why. Although, looking at images first hand will involuntarily cause us to look at it with our own meanings, understanding who took the picture, where and why they took it can help move towards the intended meaning. The historical context refers to the exact moment in time in which the image was taken. This is since the cultural meaning during that time will change later. These changes are variant on the location, political factors, cultures etc. Understanding the images history at the time it was taken is the important factor since the time it was taken can influence how it is seen. Lastly, the context of reception involves the social circumstances an image is received and how it influences the meaning. Various social factors can influence the way we read images.</p>
        <h3>Representation and Persuasion</h3>
        <p>Representation and persuasion are very closely linked together. Representation can persuade. It is very commonly used in advertising. Imagery is used in such a way that manipulates us into wanting the product or whatever is advertised. We are usually aware of this persuasion seen in advertising. Kidd mentions that this ability to persuade can be dangerous. Why is it dangerous? Well, if imagery can be placed in a manner that influences an audience to change their opinions and perspectives to a preferred meaning, that is a potential issue. Since we have clarified that representation influences how we see the world around us and ourselves, a good example would be the beauty industry – specifically the marketing of skin lightening treatments. Despite other factors that can influence the way people see themselves, skin lightening advertising has proven to be detrimental to certain social groups and how they see themselves. This is due to the advertising using imagery (such as very famous celebrities to endorse the product) to persuade people that they need to lighten their skin. Hence, the power to persuade can be dangerous.</p>
        <h3>Representation and Politics</h3>
        <p>This section discusses the frustrated relationship representation has with reality. An important term is naturalization by Stuart Hall. This refers to when something like opinions and perspectives which are entirely man-made are looked at as natural occurrences. This leads to these man-made things losing the ability to be challenged since it is now seen as absolute knowledge (Hall, 1997).As Nick Couldry identifies: Social order is not a given or natural state; it is constructed practically and represented symbolically, and media representations of the ‘order’ of social life help enact and perform that order. (Couldry 2012) Therefore, representation can be very problematic.</p>
        <p>An example discussed in the article refers to Western contexts where there is a priority to the white, heterosexual male perspectives within media. This severely causes the underrepresentation of people of colour and has resulted in a lot of consequences. Now, on a global stance, many perspectives come from a western, white, male perspective. This restriction to who gets to represent and control representation has led to very one-sided (and narrow-minded) opinions and perspectives.</p>
        <p>This article shows how much of an influence representation has. Representation is complex in the sense that it can constantly change and have various meanings based on a number of factors. It also points out how having a very niche group controlling this representation can prove to be dangerous and consequential. </p>
