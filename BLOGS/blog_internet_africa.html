            This post will focus on unpacking the visual above. Data visualization comes with a set of strategies that can help with the way in which the data is presented. Those strategies as well as how the above visual utilizes those strategies will be discusses
            </p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
            The most important point, when it comes to any sort of production, is to keep the audience in mind. When it comes to this visual, the creators and developers at informationisbeautiful.net are already aware that the people who absorb their content will not be satisfied by simple bar graphs or pie charts. Therefore, a come intricate sort of graph is used. One that explores a bit more than the simple data representation methods. </p>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>It is important to have a clear goal/structure with the actual information being represented. The information/data itself is just as important as the aesthetics used to visualize it. Informationisbeautiful.net is known for taking data and making a story with it through its representation choices. Its critical to utilize data that matters, in this case showing how access to the internet benefitted Africa is the chosen story.</p>
            <h3>Charts and Colours </h3>
            <p> The correct charts should be utilized depending on the data being shown. In the example above, we see a creative use of bars and text to show percentages. The placement of the bars around a circle representing the globe emphasize that this information is referring to Africa. The bright green used to colour the continent of Africa as well as the percentile numbers shows the focus on the African continent. The use of green overall is meant to show a growth based on the information. We associate the colour green with growth and flourishment which exactly what kind of message the visual is trying to portray. Once Africa had more data that travelled faster, there was growth in the education and employment. Overall, it is meant to display how majority of Africa was positively influenced by this. </P>
            <h3>Simplicity and Appropriateness</h3>
            <p> Concluding what information is the most significant and marking each point of data to make it easy to break down and interpret is important. The example takes on the most important points that are relevant to each other and keep is direct and easily conceivable. Data that may seem complex on paper/in text is now presented in such a way that makes it easy to identify, digest and therefore understand. </p>
            <h3>Telling a Story</h3>
            <p> When presenting information is a visual manner with the goal of conveying a message, it is important to keep it simple enough for people to understand. It is also important to order the data in such a way that gives it an obvious start and end in information. In this example, we can see the lowest percentages moving clockwise as the percentage increases. This all adds a sense of structure to the data.  We can see two outer rings on the visual that are used to visually show the difference/ the impact of certain percentages compared to others. Basically, just from looking at the visual cues, a reader can tell that employment is the lowest percentage increase since it has not cross any outer rings and internet speeds is the highest since it bypasses all the rings.</p>
