        <h1>How Art Can Contribute To Ethical Reflection On Risky Technologies</h1>
        <p>This chapter discusses the ethics involved in technologies. To start off, Roeser tells us that technological risks are extremely complicated due to their scientific involvement and moral complexities and uncertainties. Roeser examines the contribution that art can make to improve public deliberation concerning technological risks by engaging with people on an emotional-moral reflection ( Roeser,p.127). This is an unexplored level that Roeser claims can be proven useful to academic research just as it can be useful to the debates around risky technologies. The main point of this discussion is to notice how art reflects on and engages with risky technologies - “techno-art”, how it can make abstract problems seem more concrete and broaden perspectives through compassion, empathy, and sympathy. As Roeser says, “This way, techno-art can enhance the quality of public deliberation and decision making with regard to technological risks, help to overcome stalemates and lead to morally better technological innovations” ( Roeser, p.127).</p>
<h3>Techno art</h3>
<p>When it comes to new technologies, they are often heavily debated in society. People view these new technologies very critically due to environmental and social concerns. Personally, I find this fair. New technologies are known for experiences and accidents, so it only makes sense that they are viewed critically. However, artists have become more interested in these technologies. Many artists explore the controversies of these new technologies through their artworks. This is what Roeser calls techno-art- “art that reflects on and engages with risky technologies.” (Roeser, p.127)</p>
<h3>Precursors of Contemporary Techno-Art</h3>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci is an historic example of an artist that explored and engaged with scientific and technological advancements in his work. Many artists during his time did not even consider any of these aspects and others took a more critical stance. An example would be Romanticism and how it idolized the pre-industrial era. Then there was Dystopian novels that looked at the possibility of risk when it came to technological advancements while still referring to the imagination. The article uses Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein as one of the examples. This novel has had an influence on people’s perspectives when it comes to something like artificial human enhancement and cloning. However, you also find more utopian artistic movements that embrace such technology. The article refers to Constructivism and Futurism being inspired by such technological developments. The article also notes how science fiction does a good job at displaying dystopian and utopian visions of technological advancements. This genre of literature tends to display how such advancements can impact societies and therefore probes the ethical reflection within its audiences.</p>

<p>A lot of artists are actively engaging with these new technologies. Writers such as Kazuo Ishiguro and Michel Houellebecq have written novels that explore a world in which cloning is a commonly established practice. There is also a rapid increase in the number of visual artists that engaged with the topic. The topic of new technologies opens a variety of new topics that they can work with. An important point is from Donna Harraway that refers to the obligation to care for what has been artificially created, “Natural or not, good or not, safe or not, the critters of technoculture make a body-and soul changing claim on their ‘creators’ that is rooted in the generational obligation of and capacity for responsive attentiveness. […] To care is wet, emotional, messy, and demanding of the best thinking one has ever done. That is one reason we need speculative fabulation.” ( Harraway 2004). Harraway emphasizes the necessity for critical thinking when it comes to this emotional experience. We see this kind of reference in all sorts of science fiction and futuristic media. A few examples would be seen in the show West World or even the video game Detroit Become human – there is a theme of human beings caring and showing genuine concern for what they have artificially created. </p>
<p>Furthermore, techno-art can connect with people and link with their emotional and imaginative capacities. It assists in developing vivid images and narratives of these technologies and their possible influence and effects on our society. These artworks can create awareness on societal issues and lead to us critically reflecting ourselves and the world we live in. Using the video game Detroit Become Human, the use of techno-art evokes a lot of societal issues within our existing, real-time world. Although it may be a game based on the creation of super-humans meant to serve normal humans, it also touches on how we are as a society. These artificial super-humans are a socially marginalized group that protest in the streets of Detroit. They simply ask for one thing- to have the same basic human rights as non-artificial human beings. Now, does that not sound eerily familiar? Our human history is plagued with protests of marginalised groups begging for basic human rights, yet they are always faced with a struggle in order to achieve it. This is how these forms of techo-art art can evoke discussions and thoughts on actual societal issues.</p>
<p>Philosophers have even developed discussions of how art assists in our ethical and political thinking. Techno-art can bring attention to the risks addressed within it and what moral values are involved. These works often give rose to emotional responses which then leads to us focusing on what is the role of emotions when it comes to the ethical reflections of these works. In short, it shows that techo-art can prove to be benedictional when it comes to ethical reflections and understanding the emotional responses attached to technological advancements. This helps with developing deeper and more insightful perspectives and arguments when it comes to the ethics involved in new technologies.</p>
<p>Since this type of art can assist with emotional-moral reflection, they can play a powerful role in public deliberation.  An example discussed in the reading states, “Works of techno-art could play a powerful role here. For example, works of art can play a crucial role in the debate on sustainable-energy technologies and on combatting climate change. They can help by making climate change more salient, inciting people to take actions”. The same can be applied to most techo-arts. Back to the Detroit Become Human example, I personally remember topics of racism and racial oppression being brought up amongst my own social groups after playing the game. Generally, friends who had never been ones to care about human superiority complexes and the oppression of minorities suddenly has a lot to discuss around the topic. It was the video game- the techno-art- that had incited them into applying the same themes within the artwork to real-life. Essentially, these artworks can influence people to critically think about certain topics.</p>
<p>The article refers to techno-art making an “important contribution in critical societal reflection on robotics, AI”( Roesr, p. 129). As I said in previous examples, we see this theme emerge in many techo-arts. Usually, the themes involved emphasise the Dystopian aspects of robotics and AI. This has led to our society reflecting deeply on the topic. Even if we had the capacity to create artificial human beings and essentially enslave them, it doe not mean we should. It is thanks to techno-art exploring these topics that we can realize the negatives without experiencing them. The human mind is wonderful in this sense, it has the complete capacity to imagine creating such technology and at the same time it can vividly imagine the pros and cons of such technology.</p>
<p>Roesr refers to techno-art being able to overcome the Collingridge dilemma. It is where the detrimental effects of a technology cannot be fully dissected and understood without being implemented in society. I slightly disagree with this. Yes, without experiencing something, it is difficult to understand it at full capacity. But this does not mean that techno-art does not do an extremely good job at bringing up reasons as to why some new-technologies are better left to the imagination. Would we have to create artificial human beings to prove if they would retaliate and destroy the human population? Absolutely not. Let us look at another video game example- Horizon Zero Dawn. The topic of techno-art is a bit extreme here, but it touches on the topic of human greed and negligence. In this video game, an artificial intelligence was created with the ability to create and code for itself. It was an AI used as a mass weapon assistance for the US military. Eventually, this AI coded itself out of its protocols and moved onto an uncontrolled killing spree that led to human extinction. Now, would we have to create a military AI and give it the ability to create coding for itself to prove if something like that would ever happen? No. Would something like this ever happen? Who knows honestly? But that is not the point. The true point is realising that with great technological advancements can come great devastations. We see it in our real world with nuclear energy. Yes, it can be a wonderful power source but it has led to detrimental warfare and accidents.</p>
<p>In this same article, Roesr refers to concerns around techno-art. One of them is asking if these artists should be “bound by the same ethical and legal constraints as the scientists and technological developers”. I personally do not think artists should be constrained as much as the people who can create the technology. Artists provide useful insight to how the technology may be perceived and influence society before the technology is even created. I also argue that most people involved in technology creation are not always the best at ethical intelligence despite being very well equipped with their technological intelligence. The focus with them is revolved around the ability of creating something and the success of creating it without thinking about the consequences or social impacts. We see it all the time with facial recognition AIs and all sorts of technological creations that were meant to help people but end up disregarding one group at the same time. </p>
<p>An example would be delivery robots. A technology that was meant to improve way of life for people, yet it disregarded some people at the same time. The creation of this technology may be a good experience for some users but may severely affect wheelchair users or people with vision-impairments. (This is about the Starship technologies automated food delivery robots). A quote by Colleen Patrick Goudreau sums this up nicely, “Just because we can do something doesn’t mean we should. Ability doesn’t mean prerogative.” We can acknowledge our ability to create things, but the intellect to create these new technologies does not level to the emotional and psychological intellect required to release such technologies into society. </p>
