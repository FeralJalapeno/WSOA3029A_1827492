<h1>My Thoughts on this Attempt</h1>
<p> I enjoy that this attempt has a bright pink colour to draw the audience’s attention to the bars. In Knaflics readings, she mentions how the use of one, eye-catching colour is useful in captivating the audience’s attention. The rest of the graph is left in a simple black colour to avoid taking attention away from the bars. Therefore, the rest of the aspects were deemphasized to emphasize the bars. This same colour was used on the buttons in order bring audience’s attention to their text and to interact with them. </p>

<p>The buttons that change the data set also contribute to a few of my design choices. Instead of putting titles and labels around the graph and the x and y axis, I opted to condense the text and keep it in the buttons. Why did I do this? Knaflic constantly tells us throughout her readings that being concise and clear is important for good data visualisation. I felt that putting the text in the button would allow audiences to see what data they were about to click on. By clicking on, say the “Confirmed cases for COVID-19 “button, audiences are aware that they are specifically looking at data for confirmed cases. </p>
<p> However, I do feel as if the buttons could have had a simple animation of sorts, to give audiences more feedback that these buttons are something they can interact with. The cards you see throughout the blog have a lot of visual feedback to audiences in order to show they what they can interact with. I think having the same for these buttons could have helped a little. Right now, they just look like blocks with text in them. </p>
<p>Now, when it comes to the purpose and intentions of this data visualisation, I have a few problems. The data is meant to show these countries confirmed cases versus the available hospital beds per ten thousand people. Essentially, one should be able to see how few beds are available compared to the amount of cases. But the way the graphs are laid out leads to this information being overlooked at first glance. Because the bars stay the same size as the graphs change, at first glance users cannot visually notice how few beds each country has available. To combat this, something that could hold both data sets would be better, that way users can easily identify what is being compared. </p>
