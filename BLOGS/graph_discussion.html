            <h3>Problem with Pie Charts</h3>
<p>Looking at my first attempt, I went with a donut, pie chart. The problem with picking such a chart is that is does not communicate data very well, in fact, it is a poor choice. It works entirely on proportion in order to indicate difference and comparison. The human brain cannot compare the size of the different angles accurately since there is no scale indication. Reading and understanding each value of each segment is then extremely difficult to do accurately. However, simply adding in the value into each segment would help with this.</p>
<p>Looking at the image below, we can see how differentiating the values in pie charts is difficult compared to a bar graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2398/0*xGmduS_X3brOv3oR.jpg" height="500"  width="700"alt="pie chart ccompared to bar graphs" />
<p>My brain, in all honesty, could not differentiate the pie charts from one another. The bar graphs show us that there is a difference in data, and we can see it on a much better and digestible level. The piechart makes it seem as if there is not difference and therefore can be incredibly misleading.</p>
    <h3>Bar Graphs</h3>

<p>The second attempt shows a bar graph. Unfortunately this bar graph utilized ChartJS and not D3 ( which is required for the course ). This is why for the next graph, I switch to using D3. I do feel as if the first bar graph had a good hover effect. When you hover over a bar it gives you the specific data for that bar and what it is representing. I feel as if this would have been a nice touch to add to all the graphs. I will go into a deeper discussion on the last graph.</p>

<h3>The last graph</h3>
<p>In Knaflic’s chapter 6, she goes over what makes good data visualisation in simple graphs. These points can be applied to most designs in any field. Throughout the blog I emphasize how much being clear and concise is mentioned and reaffirmed. One of the key points I took away from the chapter was the use of colour. In the data visualisation, you see the use of the bright pink colour for the bars – the same pink you see throughout the website. Not only does this colour stick to the theme of the overall website, but it also acts as a single, attention grabbing colour for the audience to focus on. The rest of the graph is left in a simple black colour, for readability since it involves text and to keep the attention on the coloured bars. To bring emphasis to these bars, the rest of the graph had to be deemphasized in the process. </p>
<p>However, the point of having two graphs was to compare how few beds per thousand people there are compared to the number of confirmed cases. I do not think these graphs executed this comparison very well. Essentially, one should be able to see how few beds are available compared to the amount of cases. But the way the graphs are laid out leads to this information being overlooked at first glance. Because the bars stay the same size as the graphs change, at first glance users cannot visually notice how few beds each country has available. To combat this, something that could hold both data sets would be better, that way users can easily identify what is being compared. </p>
<p>The buttons that change the data set also contribute to a few of my design choices. Instead of putting titles and labels around the graph and the x and y axis, I opted to condense the text and keep it in the buttons. Why did I do this? Knaflic constantly tells us throughout her readings that being concise and clear is important for good data visualisation. I felt that putting the text in the button would allow audiences to see what data they were about to click on. By clicking on, say the “Confirmed cases for COVID-19 “button, audiences are aware that they are specifically looking at data for confirmed cases. </p>
<p> However, I do feel as if the buttons could have had a simple animation of sorts, to give audiences more feedback that these buttons are something they can interact with. The cards you see throughout the blog have a lot of visual feedback to audiences to show they what they can interact with. I think having the same for these buttons could have helped a little. Right now, they just look like blocks with text in them. </p>
<p>The issue is that the graphs themselves do not create the emotion or effect I was going for. This all comes down to what was discussed above, regarding the layout of the graphs and maybe the choice of graph used. Therefore, the graph does not execute the “story” I wished to tell well enough.</p>
<p>A still think combining the data sets onto one graph would have been a better choice or having them alongside each other with the same numerical labelling on the side. This would help visually communicate the comparison of how few beds there are available to the number of confirmed cases. </p>
